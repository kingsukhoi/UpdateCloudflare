# Update Cloudflare
This program is designed to take list of FQDN to update in CloudFlare and update the entries to your local IP.

# Inspiration
I didn't like DDClient, and originally wanted a simple script that could be run through Cron.

The reason there is a docker image, is because I am working at making a fully containerized enviroment.


# TODO
- [] Add example json config
